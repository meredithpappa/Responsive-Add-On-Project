            <h2>Why Plaka in Athens?</h2>
            <h3>Plaka, the neighborhood of the Gods</h3>
            <p>
              The Plaka is the oldest section of Athens. Most of the streets have been closed to automobile traffic,
              though you should still keep a watchful eye for a speeding motorcycle or delivery truck. At one time it
              was the nightclub district, but most of these closed down when the government outlawed amplified music in
              the neighborhood in the seventies in an effort to get rid of undesirables. The strategy was very
              successful and it is now an area of restaurants, Jewelry stores tourist shops, and cafes. Though it is
              quite commercialized it is still a neighborhood and arguably the nicest neighborhood in central Athens.
              Most of the restaurants are typical tourist places but the quality of food is not bad in some of them and
              if you follow my leads in the restaurant section of this guide you should have a few enjoyable evenings
              and not be unpleasantly surprised by the bill or wake up with a gastro-intestinal disorder on the day you
              were supposed to visit the Acropolis.
